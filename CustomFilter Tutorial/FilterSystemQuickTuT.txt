IF YOU DONT CARE about any unidentified Rares, you can put the Chaos-Recipe-Blocks right after the [[3000]] headline
before anything else actually inside the category.

QUICK TUTORIAL

---------------------------------------------

Every Filter is just a insane amount of Show- or Hide-blocks just like this:


Show
SetBorderColor 255 0 0
SetFontSize 40
ItemLevel >= 60
Rarity = Rare
Class "Amulets"
SetTextColor 0 0 0
SetBackgroundColor 51 187 238
PlayAlertSound 16 300

---------------------------------------------

Any line starting with " # " is just a comment and is ignored by PoE.
You can make easy changes to color and sizes as you can see its just a number after a keyword.
i. e. "SetFontSize" has a number attached used just like the Slider on filterblade.xyz which changes the Size of the Textboxes

Now when it comes to priority, the lower a Block is added, the less priority is has.
That means that the first block will overrule every single other block.
In the Neversink filter you can see the table of content right at the top after his plugs.
There you can see the priority of rules. Dont forget that some of them are Hide-Blocks.

In terms of unidentified rares, it starts off with influence rares,Explicit Mod filtering (which is empty on high strictness),
6-Socket and 5-Link, few recipe's, crafting-bases
and lastly our main category "RARE ITEMS" at [[3000]].
After that one in [[3400]] in will hide all remaining rares from itemlevel 65 to 75.

There is some leveling stuff later.
