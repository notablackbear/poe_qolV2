        This accomplishes a few tasks that only need to be performed once on start up.
        1) Determine if the included filter is in the users My Games\\Path of Exile\\ directory. If it exists we open it, and if not, we open the included default.
        2) Open that file and find the starting and ending lines of the chaos recipe items and remember those for updating. These are bound by the random strings '234hn50987sd' and '2345ina8dsf7' respectively.
        3) Store the parts of the item filter that don't change into memory. The current filter is small (~350kB), so we don't need to worry about memory. This saves from needing to ever read it again.
        4) Insert the chaos_items_filter.filter contents into the filter text and write the file to the user's USERPROFILE\\Documents\\My Games\\Path of Exile\\ directory
        We want to be reading and searching this file once.
