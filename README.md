Hello :)

I tried to update the already existing app from the main creator: https://github.com/notablackbear/poe_qolV2.
The POE_QOL_V3.exe is the standalone app. I tried to explain everything directly in the app, but here I try to explain the basics. 

Just start the POE_QOL_V3.exe, write your settings and press "Overlay" to start using the app for chaos recipe.
On start the app will create a savefile.txt next to the .exe to save some data for the next startup. Dont change anything from the file. 

When you set your main filter in the settings, the app will check for the filter for the chaos recipe items (chaos_items_filter.filter) in the same directory. If there is no existing filter for the chaos recipe items the app will create one with default filter settings. This filter can than be changed as you want, but dont change commandlines. The filter for chaos recipe items will then be automatly inserted in your main filter above the last "Hide". You can then copy and paste the inserted lines to every position in the filter you want. 

After open the Overlay you can search with the item buttons for special itemgroups to sort your loot tab faster. The new poe update will do many things automatically, but for those who dont have much tabs or for special items like 6 links, veiled, jewels, ... the sorting function is still useful.
